# Gauchian: WGS-based GBA variant caller

Gauchian is a targeted variant caller for the GBA gene based on a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) BAM file. Gauchian uses a novel method to solve the problems caused by the high sequence similarity with the pseudogene paralog GBAP1 and is able to detect variants accurately in the Exons 9-11 homology region, such as large deletions or duplications between GBA and GBAP1, and GBAP1-like variants in GBA, including p.A495P, p.L483P, p.D448H, c.1263del, RecNciI, RecTL and c.1263del+RecTL. In addition to these challenging variants, Gauchian also calls known pathogenic or likely pathogenic GBA variants classified in ClinVar. Gauchian has been tested on Illumina WGS data with standard sequencing depth (>=30X). Gauchian does not work on targeted sequencing data. Please refer to our [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.12.21266253v1) for more details about the method.

## Installation

This Python package is supported for Linux and macOS. It has been tested on CentOS 7.9.2009.

The Python dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`. Installation takes a few seconds.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Illumina/Gauchian
cd Gauchian
python3 setup.py install
```

## Running the program

```bash
gauchian --manifest MANIFEST_FILE \
         --genome [19/37/38] \
         --prefix OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX \
         --outDir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY \
         --threads NUMBER_THREADS
```

The manifest is a text file in which each line should list the absolute path to an input WGS BAM/CRAM file. Full WGS BAM/CRAM files are recommended. If you would like to use a subsetted bamlet, please subset using region files in gauchian/data/GBA_region_*.bed.

For CRAM input, itâ€™s suggested to provide the path to the reference fasta file with `--reference` in the command.

## Interpreting the output

The program produces a .tsv file in the directory specified by --outDir.
The fields are explained below:
